# Tests that the bench proxy PINS TerranSoul's thinking_mode (owner: "thinking
# is max", 2026-08-04).
#
# WHY EVERY CASE FAILS ON THE PRE-CHANGE TREE: the proxy forwarded the request
# body verbatim apart from the learn-mode category rewrite. `brain_search`
# defaults to `chat` (tools.rs:53), so every sweep measured TerranSoul's
# CHEAPEST rung — no reason-then-rank judge, no KG-edge expansion, no
# claim-level verification — while publishing under its name. On the pre-change
# tree `pins_max_when_absent` finds no thinking_mode in the forwarded body at
# all, and `overrides_a_cheaper_choice` finds the agent's `chat` still there.
#
# Hermetic: a fake upstream captures what the proxy forwards, so this needs no
# brain, no model and no network. Runs in ~2s.

# 1. no thinking_mode supplied -> pinned to CHAT.
#    HISTORY, because the reason for each step matters. Owner 2026-08-05 moved
#    max -> think on LATENCY ("timeout and uncertainty of completion"): max
#    costs ~374 s per brain_search versus ~1 s, and on a wall-clock-bounded
#    benchmark that is a CORRECTNESS cost, not a latency one. That still holds,
#    and case 2b below still guards it.
#    2026-09-06 moved think -> chat on RANKING, which the max-vs-think decision
#    never examined. tools.rs (updated 2026-09-01, i.e. AFTER the pin was set)
#    states that think adds only a non-LLM KG bridge hop, that it "CAN AND DOES
#    DROP RESULTS THE PLAIN PASS FOUND" because the fused list is truncated at
#    `limit`, that LongMemEval-S 200q scores NDCG@10 0.939 chat vs 0.510 think,
#    and verbatim: "Prefer 'chat'". chat and think are the SAME COST, so the
#    latency criterion is untouched.
#    MEASURED HERE 2026-09-06: raman-fitting failed both k=1 sweeps on `offset`
#    alone while the brain HELD the lesson naming that exact failure (26660,
#    authored four days before sweep 3). FTS ranks it 4th on the agent's own
#    query -- inside the limit=4 cut -- and it was not among the four served.
#    This assertion is the guard against the default drifting back.
