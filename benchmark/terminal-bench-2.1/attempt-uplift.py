"""⚠️ SUPERSEDED FOR THE k=1-PER-JOB ERA — USE attempt-uplift-perjob.py.

This file counts attempts WITHIN one harbor job. Since the k=1-per-job change
every job holds exactly ONE trial, so the treatment arm is always empty and
this reports "stratum B is EMPTY. This corpus cannot answer whether memory
helps". That sentence is quotable, reads like a finding, and is WRONG: the
attempts are real, they just live in separate jobs and must be indexed across
them by started_at. Measured 2026-08-08 on jobs-sonnet5 — this tool said "no
uplift signal, 230 one-attempt jobs" while the corpus held 46 tasks x up to 5
attempts, with 4 of 6 stratum-B tasks rescued by a later attempt.

Measure the attempts-2-5 uplift: the attribution signal for cross-attempt memory.

THE CLAIM UNDER TEST. With TB_DEFER_WRITES=0, attempt 1 of a task writes lessons
that attempts 2-5 of the SAME task can read. If memory is doing anything, later
attempts should be FASTER (the agent stops re-deriving what attempt 1 learned)
and at least as accurate. If they are not, memory is not paying for itself
within a task and the root cause is worth chasing.

HOW DURATION IS DERIVED, and why it is a proxy. result.json records start/finish
for the JOB, and reward per TRIAL, but no per-attempt clock. Attempts run
sequentially (TB_ONE_JOB_PER_TASK=1, TB_CONCURRENCY=1), so consecutive trial
directory mtimes are the attempt boundaries: attempt 1 spans job start -> first
trial mtime, attempt N spans mtime(N-1) -> mtime(N).

That is a PROXY and it is stated as one. It inherits any filesystem clock skew,
and a trial whose directory is touched after completion would be over-counted.
It is good enough to answer "are later attempts markedly faster", which is a
large effect, and not good enough to publish a precise per-attempt latency.

Wall-clock is also contention-sensitive: three workers share this machine, so
compare attempt 1 against attempts 2-5 WITHIN a task (same contention regime),
never across tasks.
