# The sweep died at 35/89 on 2026-08-07 with:
#
#   [sweep] token has 33 min left — EXPIRED, re-authenticate with: claude setup-token
#   [sweep] credential expired — waiting 120s for the host CLI to rotate it (attempt 2/6)
#   ...
#   [sweep] credential EXPIRED and not rotated after 10 min
#
# while `claude -p` on the same host worked perfectly. The previous session read
# that as "the host CLI has stopped rotating the credential" and wrote
# "Do not chase the 7-hour OAuth token" into RESUME.md, prescribing a long-lived
# `claude setup-token` credential the operator has to mint by hand.
#
# THE DIAGNOSIS WAS WRONG. Measured directly on this host:
#
#   at T-19min : `claude -p` succeeded, credentials mtime UNCHANGED, 18 min left
#   at T+90s   : `claude -p` succeeded, credentials mtime CHANGED, 473 min left
#
# The rotation is LAZY and CLI-TRIGGERED: it happens when the CLI is invoked and
# finds an expired token, not on a timer. So the old loop was waiting for an
# event only it could cause, and it never caused it — and it gave up at T-30min,
# never reaching the expiry where a poke would have worked. A self-inflicted
# deadlock, not an auth failure.
#
# WHY THIS TEST CAN FAIL (rules/tests-must-be-able-to-fail.md). The fixture gives
# refresh_token an ALREADY-EXPIRED credential and a stub `claude` on PATH that
# rotates it when invoked — exactly what the real CLI does. Post-change the poke
# fires within seconds, the stub runs, the credential rotates and refresh_token
# returns 0. Pre-change the very first thing the loop does is `sleep 120`, so
# under a 25-second cap the stub is NEVER invoked, no token is written, and
# refresh_token never returns — cases 1, 2 and 3 all go red. Verified against
# `git show HEAD:...run-sweep.par.sh`.
#
# No network, no real credential, no sweep: HOME and PATH are redirected into a
# temp dir, so the host's own ~/.claude is never read or written.

# `could not locate the token functions in .../run-sweep.par.sh` and failed
# without once exercising the poke ladder. Pointing it at the file that owns the
# functions is what makes cases 1-4 able to pass OR fail on their substance.
