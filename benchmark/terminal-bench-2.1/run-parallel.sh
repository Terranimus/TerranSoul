# Run the remaining sweep tasks across N PARALLEL WORKERS.
#
#   usage: run-parallel.sh [workers]        # default 4
#          DRY=1 run-parallel.sh 4
#
# WHY. Measured 2026-08-06 over the k=2 run: 60 trials, 9.9 h wall-clock, 7.5 h
# of actual trial time -- 75% utilisation of ONE task at a time, on a host with
# 24 cores and 31 GB where a task container uses 1 CPU and ~400 MB. The
# serialisation was entirely self-imposed: TB_CONCURRENCY=1 exists so ATTEMPTS
# within a task stay ordered (attempt 1 is the control), but that says nothing
# about running different TASKS at once. At ~23 min/task the remaining 63 tasks
# were a 24-hour job; four workers make it about six.
#
# HOW EACH WORKER IS ISOLATED, and each of these was a real failure mode:
#   TB_JOB_PREFIX   distinct per worker. This is what makes `newest_job_dir`
#                   race-free: the `last_job_*` helpers scope their glob to the
#                   worker's own prefix, so a task can never be classified from
#                   another worker's result.json. It also prevents job-NAME
#                   collisions, since run-dg builds the name from the prefix
#                   plus a whole-second timestamp -- two workers starting in the
#                   same second would otherwise write to one directory.
#   TB_PROXY_PORT   distinct. Two proxies on 7425 = EADDRINUSE and both runs die
#                   (measured 2026-08-04).
#   TB_STATE etc.   distinct ledgers, so workers do not interleave writes into
#                   one file and lose lines.
#   TB_LOCK         distinct, or the second worker refuses to start.
#
# THE SHARDING TRICK, so no new code is needed in the driver: run-sweep computes
# TODO = ALL - STATE. Seed each worker's STATE with every task EXCEPT its shard
# and its TODO becomes exactly that shard.
#
# SHARED ON PURPOSE:
#   the bench brain (:7424)  — cross-task learning is the point; SQLite WAL
#                              handles concurrent writers.
#   jobs/                    — merge-sweep globs prefixes and takes the BEST
#                              trial per task, so all workers' output merges
#                              with no extra step and nothing already banked can
#                              be lowered.

#
# ⛔ THE STATE FILES CANNOT ANSWER THIS, AND TRUSTING THEM SILENTLY DROPS WORK.
# `$wstate` is written with TWO different meanings mixed together: "not in my
# shard" (a topology fact) and "I finished this" (a progress fact). The moment
# the worker COUNT changes, the shards are recomputed and yesterday's "not
# mine" becomes today's "mine" — while still sitting in the file, where the
# seeding loop reads it as "already done".
#
# MEASURED 2026-08-06, after this campaign ran at 4, then 2, then 3 workers:
# 35 of the 62 remaining tasks were in a worker's shard AND marked done in that
# worker's state, despite having only ONE clean attempt. The launch reported a
# healthy "11 + 11 + 5 to run", every shard check passed, and the sweep would
# have finished having never given those 35 tasks a second attempt — then the
# merge would have published a k=2 number built on 27 tasks while looking
# complete. A silent under-run is far worse than a crash.
#
# So completion is derived from jobs/ on disk, which is the only record that is
# both durable and topology-independent. A task counts as done when it has at
# least TB_ATTEMPTS trials that did NOT error — errored trials are excluded
# deliberately, because a trial killed at setup (see run-dg.sh's reap note)
# never ran the agent and must not be banked as an attempt.
# TWO DIFFERENT NUMBERS, and conflating them costs real money.
#   TB_TARGET_ATTEMPTS  how many clean trials a task needs before it counts as
#                       DONE. This is the campaign's k.
#   TB_ATTEMPTS         how many attempts each job runs when it is launched.
# For a fresh campaign they are equal. For a k=2 -> k=5 continuation they are
# NOT: every task already has 2 clean trials, so the target is 5 but each job
# only needs to add 3. Setting both to 5 re-runs 5 per task on top of the
# existing 2 — 7 per task, ~178 surplus trials, roughly $196 wasted.

# ⚑ SHARD BY MEASURED COST, NOT ALPHABETICALLY.
#
# The shard loop below deals tasks round-robin out of $TODO, and $TODO is
# alphabetical (run-sweep.par.sh:117 walks the filesystem with `find | sort`).
# Task cost is wildly uneven — measured medians in this corpus run from ~2 min
# to over 20 min PER ATTEMPT, and every task runs k of them — so an alphabetical
# deal is effectively a random one. A sweep finishes at max(worker), so one
# worker drawing the heavy tail decides the whole wall-clock.
#
# Observed live on 2026-08-07: 83 minutes in, worker 0 had finished 3 tasks and
# worker 1 exactly 1, because `install-windows-3.11` alone was taking ~20 min
# per attempt (~100 min for its five). Neither worker was unhealthy; the split
# was.
#
# Fix: order $TODO by DESCENDING measured cost before dealing it. Round-robin
# over a descending list is the standard cheap approximation of longest-
# processing-time-first, and it needs no change to the deal itself — which
# matters, because the deal is what `.shard` and the shard-verification guard
# below both depend on.
#
# Cost comes from trial durations already on disk (both jobs dirs), so it is
# MEASURED, not guessed, and it improves as the corpus grows. A task with no
# history sorts FIRST: an unknown task is more likely to be one of the heavy
# ones nobody has finished yet, and starting early is the safe error.
#
# ⚠️ THIS BALANCES THE DEAL, IT DOES NOT SET THE RUN ORDER. `run-sweep.par.sh`
# rebuilds its own TODO from `$STATE` — a MEMBERSHIP filter — and walks tasks
# alphabetically off the filesystem, so a worker still executes its shard in
# alphabetical order whatever order it was dealt in. That is fine, and it is the
# balance that fixes max(worker): each worker ends up with a comparable share of
# the heavy tail instead of one drawing all of it. It is the same trap RESUME.md
# already records for shard FILES ("the shard is a MEMBERSHIP filter, not an
# order") — do not expect the heavy tasks to start first.

  # run died at 35/89 with "credential EXPIRED and not rotated after 10 min".
