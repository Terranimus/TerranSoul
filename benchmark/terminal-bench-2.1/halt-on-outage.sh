# Watchdog: HALT the sweep the moment the model becomes unreachable, so an
# outage cannot be recorded as a wall of 0.0 scores.
#
# THE FAILURE IT PREVENTS. When credits run out, every remaining task errors.
# classify_errored_task() then spends its retry budget on each one and writes it
# to $STATE + $ACCEPTED as "accepted as a failed trial (0.0)". Those tasks are
# now marked DONE, so resuming after the credit reset SKIPS them — the run ends
# "complete" with dozens of zeros TerranSoul never earned. Detecting that
# afterwards (credit-outage-check.sh) means unpicking ledgers by hand; not
# letting it happen is much cheaper.
#
# WHY KILLING IS SAFE. $STATE is appended per TASK, only after that task's job
# finishes. Killing a worker mid-task therefore loses the in-flight task and
# nothing else — it simply re-runs on resume. At most one task per worker.
#
# Exits non-zero on halt so the caller is notified; exits 0 when the sweep has
# finished on its own and there is nothing left to guard.
