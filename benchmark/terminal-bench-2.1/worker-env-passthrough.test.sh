#!/usr/bin/env bash
# run-parallel.sh composed the worker environment TWICE — once as a literal list
# written into `.tb-parN.launch`, and once as a SHORTER literal list for the live
# `nohup env`. adaptive-workers.sh relaunches a worker by replaying `.launch`, so
# the two lists have to agree or a relaunched worker runs under a different
# configuration than the one the sweep started with.
#
# They did not agree, and the gap had a name: TB_TOKEN_STATIC=1 was in NEITHER.
#
# RESUME.md instructs the operator to `export TB_TOKEN_STATIC=1` so the sweep
# trusts the long-lived `claude setup-token` credential instead of the 8-hour
# OAuth access token that the host CLI had stopped rotating. Shell inheritance
# carried it into the FIRST launch, which is why it looked like it worked — but
# `.launch` is an explicit enumeration, so every supervisor relaunch dropped it
# and the worker silently reverted to reading ~/.claude/.credentials.json. That
# is how the 2026-08-07 run died at 35/89 with "credential EXPIRED and not
# rotated after 10 min" while `claude -p` on the same host worked fine.
#
# WHY THIS TEST CAN FAIL (rules/tests-must-be-able-to-fail.md). Case 1 extracts
# the `worker_env=(` array — which does not EXIST on the pre-change tree, so it
# goes red immediately. Cases 2-4 evaluate that array in a sandbox and assert
# TB_TOKEN_STATIC / TB_TOKEN_FILE survive into the rendered `.launch` line and
# that replaying it reproduces them; pre-change there is nothing to extract, so
# they cannot pass either. Case 5 is the anti-regression that stops the fix from
# being "just add the variable to both lists again": it asserts the launch record
# and the live launch come from the SAME array, which is what removes the drift
# by construction. Verified red by `git stash`-ing the change and re-running.
#
# It touches NO live sweep state: run-parallel.sh itself is never executed (it
# rewrites .tb-completed-derived.txt and every worker's state file), only the
# environment-composition block is lifted out and evaluated in a temp dir.
