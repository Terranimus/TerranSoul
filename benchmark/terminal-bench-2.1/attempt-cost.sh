# COST-side attribution: do attempts 2..k cost less than attempt 1?
#
#   usage: attempt-cost.sh <jobs-dir> <prefix>
#
# Owner's expectation, and the most tangible benefit a memory can deliver:
# "run 2-5 will be much cheaper since everything is taught in first k". Cost is
# continuous, so it resolves at a far smaller n than pass rate does.
#
# MEASURED on the archived k=5 job dg-20260804-182446:
#     attempt 1   mean 58,057 output tokens / 2,094,774 in(+cache)   n=10
#     attempts 2+ mean 35,282 output tokens / 1,711,113 in(+cache)   n=9
#     -> output 0.61x, input 0.82x
#
# ⚠️ TREAT 0.61x AS A FLOOR, NOT A RESULT. That job ran before every memory fix:
# 34% of lessons were markup-corrupted with their tags destroyed, and failing
# tasks wrote nothing at all. Later attempts were reading a damaged corpus, and
# whether any of them actually received attempt 1's lesson is unverifiable there
# (memory ids were reused across brain resets). A working pipeline should do
# better; this script is how we find out instead of assuming either way.
