> **Where the raw JSON artefacts live:** committed alongside the benchmark, tracked in git. Per-task README files in this tree link to those result files directly — we do not duplicate the artefacts because individual files can reach 10+ MB and round counts will keep growing.
>
> **Artefact policy.** Only a subset of result files is committed in the current snapshot — currently the IVF-PQ scale runs and, where regenerated, the deterministic concept-tagged quality run. The expensive retrieval runs (LongMemEval-S, LoCoMo MTEB, the 100k LoCoMo-at-scale run) are wall-clock-expensive — minutes for the smallest slices, hours for the canonical 500/1976/100k runs — and require a local Ollama with `mxbai-embed-large` and `gemma3:4b`. The headline numbers reproduced in the tables above are sourced from `rules/completion-log.md` entries for BENCH-AM-* / BENCH-LCM-* / BENCH-SCALE-*; to regenerate the result files locally, run our internal benchmark harness on the same corpus, model, and judge. The deterministic concept-tagged quality bench has no Ollama dependency and is the cheapest spot-check.

## How to reproduce

All four retrieval benchmarks (LongMemEval-S, agentmemory quality, LoCoMo MTEB, LoCoMo-at-scale) are measured with our internal benchmark harness on the same public corpora, the same model, and the same judge — no estimated numbers. Results are committed alongside the harness. The deterministic concept-tagged quality bench needs no Ollama; the LongMemEval-S, LoCoMo MTEB, and 100k LoCoMo-at-scale runs require a local Ollama with `mxbai-embed-large` and `gemma3:4b`.

## MCP Gateway Parity Coverage Matrix

> **Enforcement:** [parity-enforcement-rules.md](parity-enforcement-rules.md)
> — every benchmark must validate that direct-store and gateway-routed
> retrieval produce identical results (±1.0 pp acceptance bar).

| Benchmark | Direct-Store | Gateway | Drift | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **agentmemory-quality** | ✅ 240-obs, R@10 59.9 % | ✅ Same 240-obs via gateway | ±0.0 pp | ✅ PASS |
| **longmemeval-s** | ✅ 50-q sampled, R@10 98.0 % | ✅ Same 50-q via gateway, R@10 98.0 % | ±0.0 pp (0/50 per-q) | ✅ PASS |
| **locomo-mteb** | ✅ 1976-q, R@10 57.3 % | ✅ Same 1976-q via gateway, R@10 57.3 % | ±0.0 pp | ✅ PASS |
| **locomo-at-scale** | ✅ 100k, R@10 64.0 % | ✅ Dual-parity on same DB, R@10 64.0 % | ±0.0 pp | ✅ PASS |
| **zorkgpt** | ✅ 3 arms, brain-vs-default | ✅ Bridge routes via MCP | N/A (qualitative) | ✅ ROUTED |
| **parity-personal-ai** | ✅ 22 prompts, direct MCP | ✅ Runs live MCP on 7421/7423/7422 | N/A (qualitative) | ✅ LIVE |

**Phase status:** 5/5 quantitative benches validated, 2/2 qualitative benches routed. All gateway parity checks complete. No regressions found in any validated bench.
